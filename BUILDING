To build and verify the theorems, the following dependencies are required:
  - Unix-like build environment
  - Coq 8.6 (https://coq.inria.fr/)
  - Autosubst (https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/autosubst/)
    If the build process doesn't find an autosubst directory, it will
    automatically fetch one from GitHub and build it (requires git).

Once the dependencies are installed, to build and verify the proofs simply run
    make
